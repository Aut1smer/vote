VOTE PROJECT BY REACT AND NODE

## start vote project
run shell commands:
```shell
  node ./vote-back/app.js
```
then you can use node to start a https server.


## Notice
Please modify the `./vote-back.app.js` file, change the cert and key of https. Otherwise https will not authenticate your machine, you can use acme cert by this anchor:

[ACME cert register](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh)
